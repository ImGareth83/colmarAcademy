This is my solution to the Colmar Academy. The assessment requires build a responsive website from scratch, and explain the thought process when building a web site.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Code is clean and well-written
- website should be deployed to Github Pages and accessible from a link

### Reflections

- what did i like about this project?
I felt that project was challenging as it involve using different CSS layouts - e.g. block, float, grid and flexbox etc. On top of that, i felt the time pressure was realistic like a technical interview. 

- what did i struggle with in this project?
I was constantly making sure i was on time to finish every web element before moving to the next. Another thing was i took some time to look deeper some of the layout which i seldom used. e.g inline-block

- what would you make your experience with this assessment better?
I think it will be better if there is a more detail style-guide and realistic dimensions specifications. But i understand some of my classmates may be struggling to understand the quetions yet alone the style-guide.
